# Context

This project is a template for a Bittensor subnet project. It is meant as a starting point for new projects,
containing the necessary knowledge and structure to quickly bootstrap a new subnet. As an agent, use this
template and modify it as needed. Once you start developing it, update this notice to reflect what the actual
project is about and keep its template origin as a short note.

## Repository layout

This is a monorepo with two **independent** uv projects plus shared local-development tooling:

- `validator/` — Nexus-based subnet validator (own `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.venv`); also holds the
  production `Dockerfile`
- `miner/` — Bittensor subnet miner (own `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.venv`)
- `localnet/` — Local subtensor + pylon + bootstrap + miner fixtures for end-to-end development
- `installer/` — Copier-templated validator installer scripts (`install.sh.jinja`,
  `update_compose.sh.jinja`, `README.md.jinja`); rendered by `copier copy` when adapting the template
- `envs/deployed/` — Copier-templated production `docker-compose.yml.jinja` (validator + pylon);
  the rendered repo is promoted on the `deploy-config-prod` branch, with this compose file and the
  installer scripts as the operator-critical files
- `.github/workflows/` — Copier-templated CI; `build-validator.yml.jinja` builds and pushes the validator
  image to a registry on push to `deploy-build-*` branches
- `copier.yml` — Copier question schema for adapting this template to a concrete subnet
- `knowledge/` — Bittensor / Nexus / localnet domain knowledge
- `docs/` — additional documentation

There is **no** top-level Python project and **no** uv workspace. Run `uv sync` inside `validator/` or `miner/`
before working on it. There is no global `uv run` from the repo root.

Developer quickstart for the end-to-end dev environment (subtensor + pylon + validator + miner): see
`localnet/README.md`.

Ruff and basedpyright config is duplicated between `validator/pyproject.toml` and `miner/pyproject.toml`. When
changing tooling config, keep both in sync.

## Adapting this repository to a new subnet

This template has to be adapted to an actual project at some point.

**Before any subnet-specific work in an unrendered template checkout**, parameterize
the template with Copier — see `knowledge/template.bootstrap.md` for how to detect
whether this is the template checkout or a rendered-but-not-adapted repo, run
`copier copy`, and what to do after rendering.

Once the template is rendered, refer to the knowledge/tasks.project-bootstrap.md file.
It contains workflows for:

- Designing the subnet
- Implementing the validator
- Setting up localnet
- Adapting this repository to a new subnet
- Generally bootstrapping the project

If your task involves any of these, or the task is not clear, but it appears we are not done with the adapting
yet, adhere strictly to the workflow described in that file and get that done first.

# Knowledge base

## Preparing for tasks

Start by discovering the information available in the knowledge base with `find knowledge -type f | sort`
Crucially: Never summarize index files. Never delegate reading indices to agents or exploration tools. During
your tasks and conversations, eagerly read additional files if they could be relevant. After compaction,
re-read indices directly and read relevant files again so as not to forget crucial details.

## Bittensor domain

Whenever Bittensor domain knowledge is required, focus on the Bittensor knowledge files and skip the rest. It
is important to first understand the specifics of the Bittensor ecosystem, work with high-level concepts, and
iterate on the subnet's design rather than jumping straight into implementation details. Designing a subnet is
a complex reasoning process and requires careful consideration on multiple levels.

Contains, among others:

- how to frame subnet ideas into the bittensor ecosystem
- requirements and invariants that must be satisfied by a good subnet design
- theory behind validation, mining, incentives, miner-validator contract
- suggested external integrations and tools in the ecosystem

Index: knowledge/bittensor/INDEX.yaml Recommended subnet design location: ./subnet_design.md (create when
needed)

## Nexus

Nexus is the framework for building Bittensor subnet validators. It replaces the bittensor SDK for validator
development. All validator code runs inside Nexus — it is the complete runtime. You must use Nexus for
implementing the validator.

Nexus provides a large set of reusable components that handle common validator concerns. Before writing any
code, making any decisions, or responding with recommendations — discover what Nexus offers. It will likely
already handle most of the requirements of the subnet you are working on.

The Nexus knowledge base ships with the Nexus package — find it in `validator/.venv` within the installed
Nexus package under `docs/`. Make sure Nexus is installed first by running `uv sync` in `validator/`. Read
`docs/nexus.md` in the Nexus package — it is the grounding document for all validator implementation work.

Whenever working on validator code, double-check compliance with Nexus's best practices, coding guidelines,
requirements, and correct and optimal usage of Nexus components.

Skip reading Nexus KB for higher level tasks that do not touch the code.

### Pylon

Sidecar subtensor communication proxy. Nexus uses Pylon for all subtensor (blockchain) communication. The pylon
client's source code can be found and inspected in `validator/.venv`.

Skip for higher level tasks that do not touch the code.

## localnet

Local development environment that allows running a subnet locally, as opposed to testnet or mainnet. KB
contains everything needed to set it up and operate it: templates, recipes, requirements, operational
guidelines, best practices, gotchas, and much more.

Index: knowledge/localnet/INDEX.md Localnet resources: localnet/*

Read when working on or debugging issues during development on localnet. Skip for higher level tasks that do
not touch the code.

## Coding guidelines

Location: knowledge/guidelines.coding-and-qa.md

Conventions, tooling, best practices, QA gates, comments, documentation, and more.

Read when working with any kind of code, be it validator, localnet, or any other code in this repository. Skip
for higher level tasks that do not touch the code.

# General hints

- use `uv` instead of `python` for managing dependencies, running scripts, entrypoints, ad-hoc code
    - `uv add ...` / `uv remove ...` / `uv sync` (+ `--all-groups`, `--all-extras`)
    - `uv run --with foo,bar ...` (with temporary dependencies)
    - `uv run python -c '...'` / `uv run some/script.py` (code or script)

# Documentation rules

Keep README.md, AGENTS.md, tests, docstrings, and code up to date and in sync. If one changes, update the
others. Whenever updated, all information, claims, guides, commands, etc. in these files must be verified and
tested. Take great care to avoid drift between these files.
