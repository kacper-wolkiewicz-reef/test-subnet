# test-subnet Validator

Validator node for the test-subnet Bittensor subnet. This document is for **operators**
who want to run a validator on their own host.

## Quick install

On a clean Linux host with Docker, Docker Compose, `cron`, `curl`, `bash`, and
`openssl`:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kacper-wolkiewicz-reef/test-subnet/refs/heads/deploy-config-prod/installer/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:

1. Create a working directory at `~/test-subnet-validator/`.
2. Prompt for wallet and network settings on first run and write them to `.env`.
3. Pull the latest `docker-compose.yml` from the `deploy-config-prod` branch and start
   the validator + pylon stack.
4. Install a cron job that re-syncs `docker-compose.yml` every 15 minutes so the
   validator image stays up to date.

## What this installs

Two containers managed by `docker compose`:

- **pylon** — sidecar that proxies all Bittensor / subtensor communication for the
  validator (handles wallet, weight setting, metagraph reads).
- **validator** — the test-subnet validator process built from this repo.

## Wallet & `.env`

You need the validator wallet and hotkey on disk before installing. The wallet
should be funded and registered as needed for the target network and netuid. By
default the installer mounts `~/.bittensor/wallets` read-only into pylon.

On first run the installer asks for:

- `BITTENSOR_NETWORK` (default `finney`)
- `HOST_WALLET_DIR` (default `~/.bittensor/wallets`)
- `BITTENSOR_WALLET_NAME` (default `validator`)
- `BITTENSOR_WALLET_HOTKEY_NAME` (default `default`)

`ENVIRONMENT` defaults to the install environment (`prod` for quick install),
`NETUID` defaults to `1`, and `VALIDATOR_PYLON_OPEN_ACCESS_TOKEN`
is auto-generated. See [`installer/README.md`](../installer/README.md) for the full
variable reference.

## Updates

The cron job re-runs the update script every 15 minutes; validator updates
promoted through the `deploy-config-prod` branch propagate automatically. To
force an update sooner:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kacper-wolkiewicz-reef/test-subnet/refs/heads/deploy-config-prod/installer/update_compose.sh | bash
```
